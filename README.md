# README

A simple web application for tracking and labelling in vitro cultures. The use case in mind is a small mushroom farm or spawn laboratory.

Ethnographer will help you track cell lines and generations, so that you can easily trace every unit of spawn produced back to its wild-harvested or lab-purchased origin, and identify when lines may be reaching senescence.
